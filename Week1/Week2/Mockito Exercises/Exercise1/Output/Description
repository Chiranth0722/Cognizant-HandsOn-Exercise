Exercise 1: Mocking and Stubbing (TDD using JUnit 5 + Mockito)

Description:

This test uses Mockito to:
Mock the WeatherService interface
Stub its getForecast() method
Verify how WeatherReporter uses the mock
This is a great example of unit testing with dependencies, without using the real implementation.

Expected Input & Output:
City	Mocked Forecast	Final Report
Bangalore	"Sunny with 30°C"	"Weather in Bangalore: Sunny with 30°C"
