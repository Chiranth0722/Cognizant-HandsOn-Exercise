The Financial Forecasting program is a Java application that predicts the future savings of a user based on their current investment, monthly contributions, interest rate, and time period.
This program calculates how much money a person will have in the future if they:
Start with an initial investment
Add a fixed amount every month
Earn compound interest monthly
Invest for a specified number of years
Input:
It uses a for loop to calculate monthly growth and displays the final amount at the end of the forecast period.
The user is required to enter the following values:
Initial investment (e.g., ₹2,50,000)
Monthly contribution (e.g., ₹15,000)
Annual interest rate in percentage (e.g., 10%)
Forecast period in years (e.g., 15)

Output:
The program outputs the estimated savings amount after the given number of years, considering interest and contributions.
