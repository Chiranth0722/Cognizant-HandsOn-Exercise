The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

In simple terms, it helps to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
A Factory Class decides which subclass or object to return based on given input.

It promotes loose coupling between the client and the object creation logic.

Commonly used when the exact type of object to create is determined at runtime.

Input:
The input is usually a string or value passed to the factory method indicating which type of object to create.

Output:
The output is the object created by the factory method, which can then perform its action using a common interface.
